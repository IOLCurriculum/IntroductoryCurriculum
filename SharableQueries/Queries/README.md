# A Project for Complex Multi-target FHIR Queries

This project provides examples of queries - in the form of API requests - that can be used to GET data from various FHIR Pits in the Interoperability Land environment.


## Project Overview

This project is aimed at showing what Query Kits for FHIR are and what they do. The project shows how to perform multi target queries and shows the complexities in patient matching. We used the FHIR data in the Interoperability Land to inform gaps in telehealth for health risk assessments, medication reconciliation, and social determinants of health.

The project is as a result of a partnership between [Michigan HIMSS](https://www.himss.org/), the [Interoperability Institute](https://interoperabilityinstitute.org/), and the [University of Michigan Health Informatics Programs](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-health-informatics).
