Note:  This unit uses both a PUBLIC HAPI FHIR Server and also IOL's private HAPI FHIR Servers.

The IOL-specific links in this Session 2 document must be kept up to date or students will not be able to access the private HAPI FHIR Servers (a.k.a., FHIR Pits) inside of IOL. Students must login to IOL first before they can access its private IOL HAPI FHIR Servers.
