# This Session 5 involves downloading a simple web app that interacts directly with the IOL platform.  Access to the IOL platform must be maintained for this app to work as designed.

# What does the HRA testapp do?

The HRA testapp GETs a list of questions from a Health Risk Assessment questionnaire in the Blaze Global Health FHIR Pit. The app runs on local server 5000.

## What is the main purpose of the HRA testapp?

The main purpose is to show students how a web app connects to and gets data from a HAPI FHIR Server.  It does this by using basic authentication to get data from two FHIR PITs (which are HAPI FHIR Servers) existing inside IOL.

## Instructions for running HRA testapp?

Instructions for running the app can be found in the Session 5 document.
