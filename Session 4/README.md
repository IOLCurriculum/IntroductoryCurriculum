Note:  Session 4 uses IOL's private HAPI FHIR Servers via a configuration of the API CONNNECTOR in the BUBBLE.IO low-code platform.

The IOL-specific API REQUESTS for Session 4  must be kept up to date or students will not be able to use BUBBLE.IO to access the private HAPI FHIR Servers (a.k.a., FHIR Pits) inside of IOL.
